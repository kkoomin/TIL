# CSS Flexbox

### Flexbox

- A new module in CSS3 that makes it easy to align elements to one another, in different directions and orders.
- The main idea behind flexbox is to give the container the ability to expand and to shrink elements to best use all the available space.
- Flexbox replaces float layouts, using less, and more readable and logical code.
- Flexbox completely changes the way that we build one-dimensional layouts.

### Main flexbox concepts

- `display: flex (flex-inline)`
- Flex items = flex container가 지정된 element의 direct child elements
- 가로축 = main axis, 세로축 = cross axis
