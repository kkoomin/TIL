# Natours API Building

### What is Express?

- Express is a minimal node.js framework, a higher level of abstraction.
- Express contains a very robust set of features: complex routing, easier handling of requests and responses, middleware, server-side rendering, etc.
- Express allows for rapid development of node.js applications: we don't have to re-invent the wheel.
- Express makes it easier to organize our application into the MVC architecture.

### Postman

- Tool for doing API testing
- Send the requests and receive the responses as text.
