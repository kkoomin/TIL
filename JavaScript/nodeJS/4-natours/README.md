# Natours API Building

### What is Express?

- Express is a minimal node.js framework, a higher level of abstraction.
- Express contains a very robust set of features: complex routing, easier handling of requests and responses, middleware, server-side rendering, etc.
- Express allows for rapid development of node.js applications: we don't have to re-invent the wheel.
- Express makes it easier to organize our application into the MVC architecture.

### Postman

- Tool for doing API testing
- Send the requests and receive the responses as text.

### API

- Application Programming Interface: a piece of software that can be used by another piece of software, in order to allow applications to talk to each other.

### REST Architecture

### Project

- Express ^4.xx.xx (`npm i express@4`)
- `app.js`: convention to have all the Express configuration
- Routing: to determine how an application responds to a certain client request, so to a certain URL or HTTP request which is used for that request.
- Express sends the headers (ex. Content-type..) automatically :D
